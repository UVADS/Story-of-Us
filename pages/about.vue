<p>    The Story of Us website was built by John Baxton, senior web developer for the School of Data Science, who worked in close collaboration with Sue Haas, the Schoolâ€™s information technology director. The designs for the site were created by the Charlottesville-based Journey Group.
</p>
<p>Video interviews and the audio version of The Story of Us were recorded and edited by Cody Huff, multimedia producer for the School of Data Science, who also coordinated the curation of assets for the project. Monica Manney provided the narration.
</p>
<p>Research and editorial content for the project were provided by the School of Data Science communications team of Huff, Cooper Allen, Alyssa Brown, Emma Candelier, and Kirsten Samuels.
</p>
<p>The Story of Us would not have been possible without the cooperation and generous time provided by the key figures interviewed for this project. They are Cathy Anderson, Phil Bourne, Don Brown, Arlyn Burgess, Rick Horwitz, Reggie Leonard, Melissa Phillips, Jim Ryan, Teresa Sullivan, and Jaffray Woodriff.
</p>
<p>
And to all the students, faculty, and staff who contributed to this story over the years, the School of Data Science will forever be grateful.</p>
